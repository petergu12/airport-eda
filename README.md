# ✈️ Airport Distance EDA – DSCP Final Project

This project analyzes global airport locations and calculates the distance between two airports using Python and geopy. The data was cleaned and transformed to build a coordinate dictionary.

The notebook includes distance calculations (e.g., TPE to NRT) and basic visualizations to show how airports are distributed globally.
